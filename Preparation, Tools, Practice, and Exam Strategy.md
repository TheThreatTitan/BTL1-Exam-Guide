# BTL1 Exam Guide: Preparation, Tools, Practice, and Exam Strategy

## 1. BTL1 Exam Preparation

Before you take the BTL1 exam, you should have a good understanding of security fundamentals, phishing analysis, threat intelligence, digital forensics, SIEM and incident response. All of these topics are covered in the training that comes with your BTL1 voucher. The voucher includes three months of training and lab access, plus one year of exam eligibility with two attempts.
The training is quite comprehensive but not sufficient. You need prior knowledge of some tools and how the windows operating system works for this certification. I will provide some resources of the top of my head and will continue to update. You should also do your best to complete the course and the labs.
However, for proper preparation, I have some advice:

- **Take Notes**
Document everything—your lab solutions, key observations, and any useful techniques. This will help during revision and make it easier to recall solutions during the exam.

- **Complete the Full Training**
The training is comprehensive, with hands-on labs that mirror real-world scenarios. If you can’t finish all labs before your access expires, you can supplement your learning with TryHackMe’s SOC Level 1 path.

- **Understand BTL1’s Difficulty**
BTL1 is an entry-level certification, but not an introductory one. If you’re new to cybersecurity or SOC tools, you may struggle. Make sure you have prior knowledge before attempting the exam.



## 2. Tools to Master
While the labs provide a head start, you still need hands-on experience with these critical tools:

- Splunk – SIEM analysis and querying

- Autopsy – Digital forensics

- DeepBlueCLI – Windows log analysis

- Wireshark – Network traffic analysis

- Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) – Navigating Windows remotely

Additionally, get familiar with Windows internals—understanding system processes, event logs, and artifacts will help immensely.

Tip: The exam is open book, meaning you can use AI, search engines, and external resources. If you forget a command, ask AI. If a question is unclear, research it. This is not cheating—it’s a practical skill for real-world cybersecurity roles.

## 4. Exam Strategy & Tips

The exam consists of 20 questions, each worth 5 points. To maximize your score, follow these strategies:


**Before the Exam**

- Minimize distractions – Arrange for help with daily tasks so you can focus completely.


- Mentally prepare – Get enough rest, stay hydrated, and have snacks ready.



**During the Exam**

- Read the instructions carefully – Understanding the problem fully will save you from careless mistakes.


- Analyze the questions – Identify key Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and the tools required for each task.


- Organize your workflow – Copy all questions. Group them by tool (e.g., all Splunk-related questions together).


- Use the provided resources – Each folder has a README file. If a file asks you to read it, read it.


- Research effectively – The lab environment does not have internet, except for Splunk. Use your personal browser for additional research. If you're stuck, use AI, search engines, or YouTube tutorials.


- Take breaks – Stretch, drink water, and stay calm. This is a long exam, and keeping your mind fresh is essential.



**After the Exam**

- If unsure, request a review – If you believe you answered correctly but received a low score, request a manual review. I moved from 85% to 95% this way.


- Reflect on your experience – If you struggled with a question, study that topic afterward. Continuous learning is key in cybersecurity.



## Final Words

I missed one question in my attempt because I wasn’t familiar with the topic. Now I am. Learn from my mistake—take notes and review them!
